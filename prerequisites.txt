1. Install QEMU for Windows: https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/ | QEMU for Linux Debian based: sudo apt install qemu-full qemu-kvm
2. (Windows only) Add the QEMU installation path to the system PATH environment variable. For example, in my case it is C:\Program Files\qemu\.
3. (Windows only) Turn on Windows features (Win + R, and put OptionalFeatures.exe). Specifically: Hyper-V and Virtual Machine Platform.
4. (Windows only) Enable PowerShell script execution. Open a PowerShell window as administrator and type this:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
5. (Windows only) Restart the computer (or instead, restart the explorer.exe process).
6. You can now run the script.
