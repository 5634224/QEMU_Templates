# TODO: Shared folders between host & guest
For now, until I figure out the safe way to share folders between host and guest, 
I recommend installing a SAMBA server in the Linux host (if it's Windows, it isn't necessary), 
and connecting to the SAMBA server (Windows or Linux, it doesn't matter) by logging in via the address. 
Since Linux, type smb://10.0.2.2. Since Windows, type \\10.0.2.2

If you need to install SAMBA Server in a Linux host, then you'll want to configure shared folders:
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

and then, type the following at the end of the file:

[Datos]
comment = Samba en Debian
path = /media/santiago/DATOS/
read-only = no
browsable = yes
writeable = yes
#guest ok = yes
