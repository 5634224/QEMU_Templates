# QEMU guest agent
sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent xserver-xorg-video-qxl

# Spice host & guest integration
sudo apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd
sudo systemctl start spice-vdagent.service
sudo systemctl enable spice-vdagent.service

# Host-only networking (NOT TESTED YET, thanks to https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=182320)
brctl addbr br0
ip addr add 192.168.179.1/24 broadcast 192.168.179.255 dev br0
ip link set br0 up

ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
ip link set tap0 up promisc on

brctl addif br0 tap0

dnsmasq --interface=br0 --bind-interfaces --dhcp-range=192.168.179.10,192.168.179.254

Then, you can execute qemu-system-x86_64 like following:
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1024 -netdev tap,id=t0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no -device e1000,netdev=t0,id=nic0 <imagefile>

-------------------While I'm researching bridged host-only connections, if you want to connect via SSH or port 80, you can use: -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80

# TODO: Shared folders between host & guest
For now, until I figure out the safe way to share folders between host and guest, 
I recommend installing a SAMBA server in the Linux host (if it's Windows, it isn't necessary), 
and connecting to the SAMBA server (Windows or Linux, it doesn't matter) by logging in via the address. 
Since Linux, type smb://10.0.2.2. Since Windows, type \\10.0.2.2

If you need to install SAMBA Server in a Linux host, then you'll want to configure shared folders:
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

and then, type the following at the end of the file:

[Datos]
comment = Samba en Debian
path = /media/santiago/DATOS/
read-only = no
browsable = yes
writeable = yes
#guest ok = yes
